This is the data analysis/empirical analysis used for one of my research projects, analyzing the role of GVC position on cross-border trade in environmental products. Also, the mediating effects of sectoral digital intensity and GVC participation across 75 countries are analyzed. 

The analysis harmonizes data from multiple sources: OECD multi-regional input-output tables, CEPII,and Asian Development Bank multi-regional input-output tables. The total size of dataset is around 110 GB.

Baseline analysis: A structural gravity model with Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation (The sectoral fixed effects, country-time fixed effects, and country-pair fixed effects are incorporated) is employed to account for potential heteroskedasticity in trade flows and supported by robustness checks.

Construction of Dependent Variables: 
                            The list of environmental productss used in this paper is derived from the OECD Consolidated List of EGs CLEG, consisting of 255 goods and 11 main categories in total (Sauvage, 2014). 
                            Trade flow of EGs over 75 countries from 1995-2020 are collected from CEPII at HS-6 digit product level.  Then, this analysis converts the HS 2-digit into country-sectoral level according to the ISIC Rev.4 classification. 
Construction of Independent Variables:
                            Digital intensity:
                            Following existing literature, this paper measures digital intensity at country-sectoral level. The digital intensity is a combination of direct digital input and indirect digital input, and this study measures the proportion of digital inputs as the sectoral total output within sub-manufacturing sectors to represent the digitalization of each sector.
                            GVC indicators:
                            Following Koopman et al. (2010), GVC position index and GVC participation index are constructed. 

Overall, results reveal that advancements in GVC positioning significantly boost cross-border EGs trade, following a convex pattern where higher GVC positions yield increasingly substantial marginal effects. GVC participation and digitalization are identified as key moderators of this relationship, affecting the trade-enhancing impacts of GVC positioning. Furthermore, the results uncover heterogeneous effects across different EG categories, with both linear and nonlinear dynamics emerging depending on product characteristics, which also shape the moderating roles of GVC participation and digitalization.
