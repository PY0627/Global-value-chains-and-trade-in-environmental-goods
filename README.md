This is the data analysis/empirical analysis used for one of my research projects, analyzing the role of GVC position on cross-border trade in environmental products. Also, the mediating effects of sectoral digital intensity, different kinds of digital provisions in existing trade agreements and GVC participation across 75 countries are analyzed. 

The analysis harmonizes data from multiple sources:  multi-regional input-output tables issued by multiple organzations such as Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), CEPII, and so on. Variables of digitalization, GVC indicators, and RTAs are constructed accordingly. 

A structural gravity model with Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation (The sectoral fixed effects, country-time fixed effects, and country-pair fixed effects are incorporated) is employed to account for potential heteroskedasticity in trade flows and supported by robustness checks.
